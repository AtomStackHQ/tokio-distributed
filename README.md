# Tokio Distributed
A distributed extension of tokio that provides primitives with the same semantics and API as tokio, enabling seamless task execution across a cluster of nodes.

## Overview

This crate provides a distributed runtime built on top of tokio that allows spawning tasks across a cluster while maintaining tokio's familiar API. Key features include:

- **Tokio API Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for basic tokio operations
- **Distributed Task Execution**: Spawn functions across cluster nodes
- **Node Scheduling**: Kubernetes-style tags, taints, and tolerations
- **Multiple Transports**: Process-based (IPC) and network-based communication
- **Security by Default**: mTLS and decentralized authentication
- **Zero Dependencies**: Hand-rolled implementations for static linking
- **Complete Observability**: Metrics for tasks, channels, and cluster state
